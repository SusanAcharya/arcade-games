**Arcade** is a retro-inspired arcade platform packed with mini-games that bring back the thrill of old-school gaming. Players can jump into fast, fun, and sometimes unpredictable challenges — some based on pure skill, others on pure luck. Every play session earns points, and the global leaderboard keeps things competitive.

It’s got that classic arcade vibe — bold colors, pixel-style visuals, bouncy music, and the kind of sound effects that make you feel like you’re standing next to a vintage game cabinet.

**Overview**

This project is built as a central hub for multiple mini-games that can all be played under one roof. Each game has its own twist and difficulty level, but they’re all tied together by a shared scoring and leaderboard system.

Players can:

- Play skill-based and luck-based mini-games.

- Compete for high scores on the global leaderboard.

- Experience dynamic sound, music, and effects inspired by classic arcade machines.

- Use familiar desktop key binds and controls for an interactive, responsive feel.
